# Normative modelling using the pcntoolkit - the what, when and why

This repository contains written instructions, links to code, and data for a tutorial on normative modelling. The slides accomanying this tutorial can be found [here].

It is based on the (virtual) Machine Learning/Normative Modeling Practical at the [Computational Psychiatry Course](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/) 2024.


## Overview tutorial
In this tutorial you will learn:
1. To create your own normative models using brain imaging data.
2. Use our pre-trained models to make predictions for your own data
3. Interpret and visualize the outputs of the normative models.
4. Use the deviation scores to predict schizophrenia.
